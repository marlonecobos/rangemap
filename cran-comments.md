## Submission 0.1.18
This is the first submission of version 0.1.18. In this version I have made the 
following changes based on issues detected:

* Modified function rangemap_explore to allow changing x and y limits of plot.
* Fixed issue in legend of rangemap_plot when extents of occurrence were not 
plotted.
* Added an argument in ranges_espace to allow plotting with raw variables and 
not only PCs; "do_pca = FALSE".
* Improved the way ranges were plotted in ranges_espace when occurrences were
not added. Axes and labels added.

**Comments on NOTEs**

* A NOTE may be produced because names of countries in one of the elements in data 
are marked UTF-8 strings; however, the names are correct and we consider they should stay.
* Another NOTE appears because some of the words in the Description
field in DESCRIPTION are considered mis-spelled. However, the words are correct.

## Resubmission 0.1.15
This is a resubmission. In this version I have made the following changes based 
on CRAN reviewer suggestions:

* Implemented argument 'verbose' for all functions that print messages. Now, these 
messages can be suppressed easily.
* To avoid an arbitrary definition of seed in a function where reproducibility 
is desired (clusters in helpers.R), an extra argument (set_seed) was added to 
the function to allow explicit control on such seed.
* Added vignettes to the package created by the author added to the list of authors.

**Comments on NOTEs**

* A NOTE may be produced because names of countries in one of the elements in data 
are marked UTF-8 strings; however, the names are correct and we consider they should stay.
