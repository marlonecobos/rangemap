\title{Species distributional ranges based on buffered occurrences}
\usage{
rangemap_buffer(occurrences, buffer_distance = 100000, polygons = NULL,
                extent_of_occurrence = TRUE, area_of_occupancy = TRUE,
                final_projection = NULL, save_shp = FALSE, name,
                overwrite = FALSE, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{occurrences}{a data.frame containing geographic coordinates of species
occurrences, columns must be: Species, Longitude, and Latitude. Geographic
coordinates must be in decimal degrees (WGS84).}

\item{buffer_distance}{(numeric) distance, in meters, to be used for creating
the buffer areas around occurrences, default = 100000.}

\item{polygons}{(optional) a SpatialPolygons* object to clip buffer areas and
adjust the species range and other polygons to these limits. Projection must
be WGS84 (EPSG:4326). If \code{NULL}, the default, a simplified world map
will be used.}

\item{extent_of_occurrence}{(logical) whether to obtain the extent of occurrence
of the species based on a simple convex hull polygon; default = \code{TRUE}.}

\item{area_of_occupancy}{(logical) whether to obtain the area of occupancy
of the species based on a simple grid of 4 km^2 resolution;
default = \code{TRUE}.}

\item{final_projection}{(character) string of projection arguments for
resulting Spatial objects. Arguments must be as in the PROJ.4 documentation.
See \code{\link[sp]{CRS-class}} for details. If \code{NULL}, the default,
projection used is WGS84 (EPSG:4326).}

\item{save_shp}{(logical) if \code{TRUE}, shapefiles of the species range,
occurrences, extent of occurrence, and area of occupancy will be written in
the working directory, or the path described as part of \code{name}.
Default = \code{FALSE}.}

\item{name}{(character) valid if \code{save_shp} = \code{TRUE}. The name of
the shapefile to be exported. A suffix will be added to \code{name} depending
on the object, as follows: species extent of occurrence = "_extent_occ", area
of occupancy = "_area_occ", and occurrences = "_unique_records". If a path
different to the working directory is included as part of this name, files
will be written in such a directory.}

\item{overwrite}{(logical) whether or not to overwrite previous results with
the same name. Default = \code{FALSE}.}

\item{verbose}{(logical) whether or not to print messages about the process.
Default = TRUE.}
}
\value{
A sp_range object (S4) containing: (1) a data.frame with information about the
species range, and Spatial objects of (2) unique occurrences, (3) species range,
(4) extent of occurrence, and (5) area of occupancy.

If \code{extent_of_occurrence} and/or \code{area_of_occupancy} = \code{FALSE},
the corresponding spatial objects in the resulting sp_range object will be
empty, an areas will have a value of 0.
}
\description{
rangemap_buffer generates a distributional range for a given
species by buffering provided occurrences using a defined distance. Optionally,
representations of the species extent of occurrence (using convex hulls) and
the area of occupancy according to the IUCN criteria can also be generated.
Shapefiles can be saved in the working directory if it is needed.
}
\details{
All resulting Spatial objects in the results will be projected to the
\code{final_projection}. Areas are calculated in square kilometers using the
Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection, centered on the centroid of occurrence
points given as inputs.
